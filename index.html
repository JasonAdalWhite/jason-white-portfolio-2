        <p>Aspiring Software Developer out of South Carolina</p>
        <div>
            <p>
                I am currently enrolled at the UNCC (University of North Carolina Charlotte) Coding Bootcamp, as well as finishing a degree 
                in Computer Science from USC Upstate!
                I have a lot of experience with HTML and CSS, but I'm not great with design! My brain is much more logic
                oriented and I prefer using JavaScript to build the mechanical side of applications! I am currently delving in 
                advanced Python and C+ in order to build more advanced computer applications! 
                My favorite food is tteok-bokki, I have a cat named Espresso, and my favorite animals are bears!
